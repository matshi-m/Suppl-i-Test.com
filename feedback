# Challenge Feedback

Overall the quality of the answers we good. There were a few issues with consistency especially on the JavaScript side.
Also, one of the requirements was to create a private repo which was not met.
Please do make this repo private as I will use it as a reference should we have more dev roles open up and may add an additional question here. 

Thank you for trying the challenges.
